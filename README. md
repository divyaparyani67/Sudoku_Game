Sudoku is divided into 9 intermediate boxes, which are further divided into 9 fundamental (smallest) boxes, which contain numbers from 1 to 9.

A part of the puzzle is already there, your objective is to fill out the remaining numbers keeping the following 2 rules in mind:

1. Each row should have the numbers 1 to 9, with none of them being repeated.
2. Each intermediate box should have the numbers 1 to 9, with none repeating.

This puzzle looks deceptively simple, but it blows you away. Solving it without a computer is challenging enough; making an algorithm to do the same provides numerous learning challenges along the way. After you arrive at a solution, your brain will never be the same.
